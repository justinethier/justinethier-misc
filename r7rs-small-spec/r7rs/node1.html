<P>
Husk is an implementation of the Scheme programming language that runs on top of the Haskell Platform.
TBD: standalone interpreter, rudimentary compiler, embedability
</p>
<P>
This user manual provides documentation for Husk Scheme, including a detailed description of the Scheme language as implemented by Husk. This manual is based on the Revised<sup>7</sup> Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme (R<sup>7</sup>RS). 

As such it provides a detailed description of the Scheme language, and is meant to be good enough that in most cases a user will not need to reference the Scheme reports. However, this manual does not copy the R<sup>7</sup>RS verbatim and does leave out many details that are of more interest to a Scheme implementor rather than a practical user of the language. If those details are important to you, you may need to reference the Scheme report itself. 
</p>

<P>
Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail recursive
dialect of the Lisp programming language&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node105.html#McCarthy">23</A>] invented by Guy Lewis
Steele&nbsp;Jr. and Gerald Jay&nbsp;Sussman.  It was designed to have
exceptionally clear and simple semantics and few different ways to
form expressions.  A wide variety of programming paradigms, including
imperative, functional, and object-oriented styles, find convenient
expression in Scheme.
</p>

<P>
The introduction offers a brief history of the language and of
the report.
</p>

<P>
The first three chapters present the fundamental ideas of the
language and describe the notational conventions used for describing the
language and for writing programs in the language.
</p>

<P>
Chapters&nbsp;<A HREF="node26.html#expressionchapter">4</A> and&nbsp;<A HREF="node49.html#programchapter">5</A> describe
the syntax and semantics of expressions, definitions, programs, and libraries.
</p>

<P>
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node62.html#builtinchapter">6</A> describes Scheme's built-in
procedures, which include all of the language's data manipulation and
input/output primitives.
</p>

<P>
Appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="node97.html#stdlibraries">A</A> provides a list of the standard libraries
and the identifiers that they export.
</p>

<P>
Appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="node98.html#stdfeatures">B</A> provides a list of optional but standardized
implementation feature names.
</p>

<P>
The report concludes with a list of references and an
alphabetic index.
