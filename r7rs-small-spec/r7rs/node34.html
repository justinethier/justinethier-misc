<EM>Semantics: </EM>
<code>include</code> takes one or more filenames expressed as string literals,
applies an implementation-specific algorithm to find corresponding files,
reads the contents of the files in the specified order as if by repeated applications
of <code>read</code>,
and effectively replaces the <code>include</code> expression
with a <code>begin</code> expression containing what was read from the files.
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM> 
By default, Husk will search for files from the current directory. If a file is not found, Husk will attempt to load it from the Husk system directory.
