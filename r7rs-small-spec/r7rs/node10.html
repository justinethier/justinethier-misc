<P>
Every identifier defined in this report appears in one or more of several <EM>libraries</EM>.  Identifiers defined in the <EM>base library</EM> are not marked specially in the body of the report.  
This library includes the core syntax of Scheme
and generally useful procedures that manipulate data.  For example, the
variable <span class="code">abs</span> is bound to a
procedure of one argument that computes the absolute value of a
number, and the variable <span class="code">+</span> is bound to a procedure that computes sums.  The full list 
all the standard libraries and the identifiers they export is given in
Appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="node97.html#stdlibraries">A</A>.
