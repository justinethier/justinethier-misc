<p>
Explicit renaming (ER) macros provide an alternative macro transformer spec that allows a macro to execute the full Scheme language. Note that, unlike <code>syntax-rules</code>, <code>er-macro-transformer</code> is a low-level macro system that does not support hygiene unless identifiers are explicitly renamed using the <code>rename</code> function parameter.
</p>
<P>
The explicit renaming transformer has the following form:
</P>
<P>
<div id="er-macro-transformer" class="obj-box">
  <div class="obj-header">
    <span class="code">(er-macro-transformer </span>
    <span class="code-var"> (lambda ({expression} rename compare) {body})</span>
    <span class="code">)</span>
    <span class="obj-type">syntax</span>
  </div>
</div>
</p>

<p>
Expression is the code to be transformed by the macro.
</p>
<p>
<code>rename</code> is a procedure passed to the macro that takes a single symbol as its argument. The function will explicitly rename the symbol by returning another unique symbol.
</p>
<p>
<code>compare</code> is a function that takes two symbols and returns a boolean indicating whether the symbols refer to the same object.
</p>
<p>
Body is the Scheme code that will be executed when the macro is called, to transform the given expression.
</p>

<p>
For example, here is an explicit renaming macro <code>(swap! x y)</code> to swap the contents of two variables:

<div class="code-block">
(define-syntax swap!
  (er-macro-transformer
    (lambda (form rename compare?)
      (let (
        (x (cadr form))
        (y (caddr form))
        (%tmp (rename 'tmp))
        (%let (rename 'let))
        (%set! (rename 'set!))
        )
        `(,%let ((,%tmp ,x))
           (,%set! ,x ,y)
           (,%set! ,y ,%tmp))))))
</div>
</p>

<p>
Husk's implementation of explicit renaming macros is based on the paper <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Hygienic+Macros+Through+Explicit+Renaming">Hygienic Macros Through Explicit Renaming</a> by William Clinger, which explains them in more detail.
