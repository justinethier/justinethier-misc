{{ page.title }}

<P>
By convention, <span class="code">?</span> is the final character of the names
of procedures that always return a boolean value.
Such procedures are called <EM>predicates</EM>.
Predicates are generally understood to be side-effect free, except that they
may raise an exception when passed the wrong type of argument.
</p>
<P>
Similarly, <span class="code">!</span> is the final character of the names
of procedures that store values into previously
allocated locations (see section&nbsp;<A HREF="node24.html#storagemodel">3.4</A>).
Such procedures are called <EM>mutation procedures</EM>.
The value returned by a mutation procedure is unspecified.
</p>
<P>
By convention, <span class="code">-&gt;</span> appears within the names of procedures that
take an object of one type and return an analogous object of another type.
For example, <span class="code">list-&gt;vector</span> takes a list and returns a vector whose
elements are the same as those of the list.
</p>
<P>
A <EM>command</EM> is a procedure that does not return useful values
to its continuation.
</p>
<P>
A <EM>thunk</EM> is a procedure that does not accept arguments.
