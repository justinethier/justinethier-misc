<P>
Implementations of Scheme are required to be
<EM>properly tail-recursive</EM>.
Procedure calls that occur in certain syntactic
contexts defined below are <EM>tail calls</EM>.  A Scheme implementation is
properly tail-recursive if it supports an unbounded number of active
tail calls.  A call is <EM>active</EM> if the called procedure might still
return.  Note that this includes calls that might be returned from either
by the current continuation or by continuations captured earlier by
<code>call-with-current-continuation</code> that are later invoked.
In the absence of captured continuations, calls could
return at most once and the active calls would be those that had not
yet returned.
A formal definition of proper tail recursion can be found
in&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node105.html#propertailrecursion">6</A>].
