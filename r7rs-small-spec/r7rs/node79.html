This section describes various primitive procedures which
control the flow of program execution in special ways. Procedures
in this section that invoke procedure arguments always
do so in the same dynamic environment as the call of
the original procedure. The <code>procedure?</code> predicate is also
described here.

  <div class="p"><!----></div>
It is an error if proc does not accept one argument.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
The procedure call-with-current-continuation (or its
equivalent abbreviation call/cc) packages the current
continuation (see the rationale below) as an "escape procedure"
and passes it as an argument to proc. The escape
procedure is a Scheme procedure that, if it is later called,
will abandon whatever continuation is in ect at that later
time and will instead use the continuation that was in effect
when the escape procedure was created. Calling the
escape procedure will cause the invocation of before and
after thunks installed using dynamic-wind.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <br />
The escape procedure accepts the same number of arguments
as the continuation to the original call to
call-with-current-continuation. Most continuations
take only one value. Continuations created by the
call-with-values procedure (including the initialization
expressions of define-values, let-values, and
let*-values expressions), take the number of values
that the consumer expects. The continuations
of all non-final expressions within a sequence of expressions,
such as in lambda, case-lambda, begin,
let, let*, letrec, letrec*, let-values, let*-values,
let-syntax, letrec-syntax, parameterize, guard,
case, cond, when, and unless expressions, take an arbitrary
number of values because they discard the values
passed to them in any event. The ect of passing no values
or more than one value to continuations that were not
created in one of these ways is unspecified.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <br />
The escape procedure that is passed to proc has unlimited
extent just like any other procedure in Scheme. It can be
stored in variables or data structures and can be called as
many times as desired. However, like the raise and error
procedures, it never returns to its caller.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <br />
The following examples show only the simplest ways
in which call-with-current-continuation is used. If
all real uses were as simple as these examples, there
would be no need for a procedure with the power of
call-with-current-continuation.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <div class="code-block">
(call-with-current-continuation
  (lambda (exit)
    (for-each (lambda (x)
                (if (negative? x)
                    (exit x)))
        '(54 0 37 -3 245 19))
  #t)) ==&gt; -3

(define list-length
  (lambda (obj)
    (call-with-current-continuation
      (lambda (return)
        (letrec ((r
            (lambda (obj)
              (cond ((null? obj) 0)
                    ((pair? obj)
                     (+ (r (cdr obj)) 1))
                    (else (return #f))))))
          (r obj))))))
(list-length '(1 2 3 4)) ==&gt; 4
(list-length '(a b . c)) ==&gt; #f
</div>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />
Rationale:
<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />
A common use of call-with-current-continuation is for
structured, non-local exits from loops or procedure bodies, but
in fact call-with-current-continuation is useful for imple-
menting a wide variety of advanced control structures. In fact,
raise and guard provide a more structured mechanism for non-
local exits.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />
Whenever a Scheme expression is evaluated there is a contin-
uation wanting the result of the expression. The continuation
represents an entire (default) future for the computation. If the
expression is evaluated at the REPL, for example, then the con-
tinuation might take the result, print it on the screen, prompt
for the next input, evaluate it, and so on forever. Most of the
time the continuation includes actions specified by user code,
as in a continuation that will take the result, multiply it by
the value stored in a local variable, add seven, and give the an-
swer to the REPL's continuation to be printed. Normally these
ubiquitous continuations are hidden behind the scenes and pro-
grammers do not think much about them. On rare occasions,
however, a programmer needs to deal with continuations explic-
itly. The call-with-current-continuation procedure allows
Scheme programmers to do that by creating a procedure that
acts just like the current continuation.

Calls its producer argument with no arguments and a
continuation that, when passed some values, calls the
consumer procedure with those values as arguments. The
continuation for the call to consumer is the continuation
of the call to call-with-values.

  </div>
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
Calls thunk without arguments, returning the result(s) of
this call. Before and after are called, also without arguments,
as required by the following rules. Note that,
in the absence of calls to continuations captured using
call-with-current-continuation, the three arguments
are called once each, in order. Before is called whenever
execution enters the dynamic extent of the call to thunk
and after is called whenever it exits that dynamic extent.
The dynamic extent of a procedure call is the period between
when the call is initiated and when it returns. The
before and after thunks are called in the same dynamic
environment as the call to dynamic-wind. In Scheme, because
of call-with-current-continuation, the dynamic
extent of a call is not always a single, connected time period.
It is defined as follows:
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <ul>

<li>The dynamic extent is entered when execution of the
body of the called procedure begins.</li>

<li>The dynamic extent is also entered when execution
is not within the dynamic extent and a
continuation is invoked that was captured (using
call-with-current-continuation) during the dynamic
extent.</li>
<li>It is exited when the called procedure returns.</li>
<li>It is also exited when execution is within the dynamic
extent and a continuation is invoked that was captured
while not within the dynamic extent.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <br />
If a second call to dynamic-wind occurs within the dynamic
extent of the call to thunk and then a continuation is invoked
in such a way that the after s from these two invocations
of dynamic-wind are both to be called, then the after
associated with the second (inner) call to dynamic-wind is
called first.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <br />
If a second call to dynamic-wind occurs within the dynamic
extent of the call to thunk and then a continuation
is invoked in such a way that the befores from these
two invocations of dynamic-wind are both to be called,
then the before associated with the first (outer) call to
dynamic-wind is called first.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <br />
If invoking a continuation requires calling the before from
one call to dynamic-wind and the after from another, then
the after is called first.
The ect of using a captured continuation to enter or exit
the dynamic extent of a call to before or after is unspecified.
