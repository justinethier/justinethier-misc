No object satisfies more than one of the following predicates:

<br />
<div class="code-block">
boolean?          bytevector?
char?             eof-object?
null?             number?
pair?             port?
procedure?        string?
symbol?           vector?
</div>
<br />

and all predicates created by <code>define-record-type</code>.
</p>

<P>
These predicates define the types 
<EM>boolean, bytevector, character</EM>, the empty list object,
<EM>eof-object, number, pair, port, procedure, string, symbol, vector</EM>,
and all record types.
</p>
<P>
Although there is a separate boolean type,
any Scheme value can be used as a boolean value for the purpose of a
conditional test.  As explained in section&nbsp;<A HREF="node72.html#booleansection">6.3</A>, all
values count as true in such a test except for <code>#f</code>.
This report uses the word "true" to refer to any
Scheme value except <code>#f</code>, and the word "false" to refer to
<code>#f</code>.
