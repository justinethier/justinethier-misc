<P>
An identifier is any sequence of letters, digits, and
"extended identifier characters" provided that it does not have a prefix
which is a valid number.  
However, the  <TT>.</TT> token (a single period) used in the list syntax
is not an identifier.
</p>
<P>
All implementations of Scheme must support the following extended identifier
characters:
<br />
<div class="code-block">
! $ % &amp; * + - . / : &lt; = &gt; ? @ ^ _ ~
</div>
</p>

<!--
<P style="color: red">
JAE TODO: not supported yet

Alternatively, an identifier can be represented by a sequence of zero or more
characters enclosed within vertical lines (|), analogous to
string literals.  Any character, including whitespace characters, but
excluding the backslash and vertical line characters,
can appear verbatim in such an identifier.
In addition, characters can be
specified using either an inline hex escape
or the same escapes available in strings.
< /p >
-->

<P>
For example, the
identifier <code>|H\x65;llo|</code> is the same identifier as
<code>Hello</code>, and in an implementation that supports the appropriate
Unicode character the identifier <code>|\x3BB;|</code> is the same as the
identifier <code>&lambda;</code>.  
What is more, <code>|\t\t|</code> and <code>|\x9;\x9;|</code> are the
same.
Note that <code>||</code> is a valid identifier that is different from any other
identifier.
</p>

<P>
Here are some examples of identifiers:
<br />
<div class="code-block">
...                 +
+soup+              <=?
->string            a34kTMNs
lambda              list-&gt;vector
q                   V17a
|two words|         |two\x20;words|
the-word-recursion-has-many-meanings
</div>
</p>
<P>
Identifiers have two uses within Scheme programs:
<UL>
<LI>Any identifier can be used as a variable
 or as a syntactic keyword 
(see sections&nbsp;<A HREF="node21.html#variablesection">3.1</A> and&nbsp;<A HREF="node45.html#macrosection">4.3</A>).
</LI>
<LI>When an identifier appears as a literal or within a literal
(see section&nbsp;<A HREF="node29.html#quote">4.1.2</A>), it is being used to denote a <EM>symbol</EM>
(see section&nbsp;<A HREF="node74.html#symbolsection">6.5</A>).
</LI>
</UL>
