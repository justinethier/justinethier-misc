<P>
The binding constructs <code>let</code>, <code>let*</code>, <code>letrec</code>, <code>letrec*</code>,
<code>let-values</code>, and <code>let*-values</code>
give Scheme a block structure, like Algol 60.  The syntax of the first four
constructs is identical, but they differ in the regions  they establish
for their variable bindings.  In a <code>let</code> expression, the initial
values are computed before any of the variables become bound; in a
<code>let*</code> expression, the bindings and evaluations are performed
sequentially; while in <code>letrec</code> and <code>letrec*</code> expressions,
all the bindings are in
effect while their initial values are being computed, thus allowing
mutually recursive definitions.
The <code>let-values</code> and <code>let*-values</code> constructs are analogous to <code>let</code> and <code>let*</code>
respectively, but are designed to handle multiple-valued expressions, binding
different identifiers to the returned values.

The <code>let*</code> binding construct is similar to <code>let</code>, but the bindings are performed
sequentially from left to right, and the region of a binding indicated
by <code>(variable init)</code> is that part of the <code>let*</code>
expression to the right of the binding.  Thus the second binding is done
in an environment in which the first binding is visible, and so on.
The variables need not be distinct.

The variables are bound to fresh locations holding unspecified

of the corresponding init, the body is evaluated in the

The variables are bound to fresh locations,
each variable is assigned in left-to-right order to the
result of evaluating the corresponding init, the body is
evaluated in the resulting environment, and the values of the last
expression in body are returned.
Despite the left-to-right evaluation and assignment order, each binding of
a variable has the entire <code>letrec*</code> expression as its
region, making it possible to define mutually recursive
procedures.
</P>
<P>
If it is not possible to evaluate each init without assigning or
referring to the value of the corresponding variable or the
variable of any of the bindings that follow it in
bindings, it is an error.
Another restriction is that it is an error to invoke the continuation
of an init more than once.

formals are matched to the return values in the same way that
the formals in a <code>lambda</code> expression are matched to the

body as its region.

The <code>let*-values</code> construct is similar to <code>let-values</code>, but the
inits are evaluated and bindings created sequentially from
left to right, with the region of the bindings of each formals
including the inits to its right as well as body.  Thus the
second init is evaluated in an environment in which the first
set of bindings is visible and initialized, and so on.
