Note case-lambda has not been implemented by Husk yet, but will be
included in a future release.

<EM>Syntax: </EM>
Each clause is of the form
(formals body),
where formals and body have the same syntax
as in a <code>lambda</code> expression.
<P>
<EM>Semantics: </EM>
A <code>case-lambda</code> expression evaluates to a procedure that accepts
a variable number of arguments and is lexically scoped in the same
manner as a procedure resulting from a <code>lambda</code> expression. When the procedure
is called, the first clause for which the arguments agree
with formals is selected, where agreement is specified as for
the formals of a <code>lambda</code> expression. The variables of formals are
bound to fresh locations, the values of the arguments are stored in those
locations, the body is evaluated in the extended environment,
and the results of body are returned as the results of the
procedure call.
</P>
<P>
It is an error for the arguments not to agree with
the formals of any clause.
