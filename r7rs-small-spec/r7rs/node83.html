<p>
Ports represent input and output devices. To Scheme, an
input port is a Scheme object that can deliver data upon
command, while an output port is a Scheme object that can
accept data. Different port types operate on different data.
</p>
<p>
A textual port supports reading or writing of individual
characters from or to a backing store containing characters
using read-char and write-char below, and it supports
operations defined in terms of characters, such as read and
write.
</p>
<p>
A binary port supports reading or writing of individual
bytes from or to a backing store containing bytes using
read-u8 and write-u8 below, as well as operations defined
in terms of bytes. 
</p>
<p>
Ports can be used to access files, devices, and similar things
on the host system on which the Scheme program is running.

JAE TODO:

(call-with-port port proc) procedure
It is an error if proc does not accept one argument.
The call-with-port procedure calls proc with port as an
argument. If proc returns, then the port is closed automatically
and the values yielded by the proc are returned.
If proc does not return, then the port must not be closed
automatically unless it is possible to prove that the port
will never again be used for a read or write operation.
Rationale: Because Scheme's escape procedures have unlimited
extent, it is possible to escape from the current continuation
but later to resume it. If implementations were permitted to
close the port on any escape from the current continuation,
then it would be impossible to write portable code using both
call-with-current-continuation and call-with-port.

These procedures obtain a textual port obtained by
opening the named file for input or output as if by
open-input-file or open-output-file. The port and
proc are then passed to a procedure equivalent to
call-with-port.

The file is opened for input or output as if by
open-input-file or open-output-file, and the new port
is made to be the value returned by current-input-port
or current-output-port (as used by (read), (write
obj ), and so forth). The thunk is then called with no
arguments. When the thunk returns, the port is closed
and the previous default is restored. It is an error if thunk
does not accept zero arguments. Both procedures return
the values yielded by thunk. If an escape procedure is used
to escape from the continuation of these procedures, they
behave exactly as if the current input or output port had
been bound dynamically with parameterize.
