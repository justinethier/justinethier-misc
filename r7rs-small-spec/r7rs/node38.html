JAE TODO: first form is not implmented?? will need to come back to this

<p>
Both of Scheme's sequencing constructs are named <code>begin</code>, but the two
have slightly different forms and uses:
</p>
<P>
<div id="begin" class="obj-box">
  <div class="obj-header">
    <span class="code">(begin </span>
    <span class="code-var">{expression or definition} ...</span>
    <span class="code">)</span>
    <span class="obj-type">syntax</span>
  </div>
This form of <code>begin</code> can appear as part of a body, or at the
outermost level of a program, or at the REPL, or directly nested
in a <code>begin</code> that is itself of this form.
It causes the contained expressions and definitions to be evaluated
exactly as if the enclosing <code>begin</code> construct were not present.
<P>
<EM>Rationale:</EM> This form is commonly used in the output of
macros (see section&nbsp;<A HREF="node45.html#macrosection">4.3</A>)
which need to generate multiple definitions and
splice them into the context in which they are expanded.
</div>
</p>
-->

<p>
<div id="" class="obj-box">
  <div class="obj-header">
    <span class="code">(begin </span>
    <span class="code-var">{expression1} {expression2} ...</span>
    <span class="code">)</span>
    <span class="obj-type">syntax</span>
  </div>
This form of <code>begin</code> can be used as an ordinary expression.
The expressions are evaluated sequentially from left to right,
and the values of the last expression are returned. This
expression type is used to sequence side effects such as assignments
or input and output.
<br />
<div class="code-block">
(define x 0)

(and (= x 0)
  (begin (set! x 5)
    (+ x 1)))           ==&gt; 6

(begin (display "4 plus 1 equals ")
  (display (+ 4 1)))   ==&gt; unspecified and prints
                              4 plus 1 equals 5
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>
Note that there is another form of <code>begin</code> used as a library declaration:
see section&nbsp;<A HREF="node59.html#librarydeclarations">5.6.1</A>.
