<p>
A pair (sometimes called a dotted pair) is a record structure
with two fields called the car and cdr fields (for historical
reasons). Pairs are created by the procedure cons. The
car and cdr fields are accessed by the procedures car and
cdr. The car and cdr fields are assigned by the procedures
set-car! and set-cdr!.
</p>
<p>
Pairs are used primarily to represent lists. A list can be
defined recursively as either the empty list or a pair whose
cdr is a list. More precisely, the set of lists is defined as
the smallest set X such that
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The empty list is in X.
</li>
<li>
If list is in X, then any pair whose cdr field contains
list is also in X.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The objects in the car fields of successive pairs of a list are
the elements of the list. For example, a two-element list
is a pair whose car is the first element and whose cdr is a
pair whose car is the second element and whose cdr is the
empty list. The length of a list is the number of elements,
which is the same as the number of pairs.
</p>
<p>
The empty list is a special object of its own type. It is not
a pair, it has no elements, and its length is zero.
Note: The above definitions imply that all lists have finite
length and are terminated by the empty list.
</p>
<p>
The most general notation (external representation) for
Scheme pairs is the "dotted" notation <span class="code">(c1 . c2)</span> where c1
is the value of the car field and c2 is the value of the cdr
field. For example <span class="code">(4 . 5)</span> is a pair whose car is 4 and
whose cdr is 5. Note that <span class="code">(4 . 5)</span> is the external representation
of a pair, not an expression that evaluates to a
pair.
</p>
<p>
A more streamlined notation can be used for lists: the
elements of the list are simply enclosed in parentheses and
separated by spaces. The empty list is written (). For
example,
(a b c d e)
and
(a . (b . (c . (d . (e . ())))))
are equivalent notations for a list of symbols.
A chain of pairs not ending in the empty list is called an
improper list. Note that an improper list is not a list.
The list and dotted notations can be combined to represent
improper lists:
(a b c . d)
is equivalent to
(a . (b . (c . d)))
</p>
<p>
Whether a given pair is a list depends upon what is stored
in the cdr field. When the set-cdr! procedure is used, an
object can be a list one moment and not the next:
</p>
<p>
  <span class="code-block">
(define x (list 'a 'b 'c))
(define y x)
y ==> (a b c)
(list? y) ==> #t
(set-cdr! x 4) ==> unspecified
x ==> (a . 4)
(eqv? x y) ==> #t
y ==> (a . 4)
(list? y) ==> #f
(set-cdr! x x) ==> unspecified
(list? x) ==> #f
</span>

</p>
<p>
Within literal expressions and representations of objects
read by the read procedure, the forms 'hdatumi,
datumi, ,hdatumi, and ,@hdatumi denote two-element
lists whose first elements are the symbols quote,
quasiquote, unquote, and unquote-splicing, respectively.
The second element in each case is hdatumi. This
convention is supported so that arbitrary Scheme programs
can be represented as lists. That is, according to Scheme's
grammar, every expression is also a datum. Among other things,
this permits the read procedure to parse Scheme programs. See section 3.3.

(set-cdr! pair obj ) procedure
Stores obj in the cdr field of pair .
(caar pair) procedure
(cadr pair) procedure
(cdar pair) procedure
(cddr pair) procedure
These procedures are compositions of car and cdr as follows:
(define (caar x) (car (car x)))
(define (cadr x) (car (cdr x)))
(define (cdar x) (cdr (car x)))
(define (cddr x) (cdr (cdr x)))
(caaar pair) cxr library procedure
(caadr pair) cxr library procedure
...
...
(cdddar pair) cxr library procedure
(cddddr pair) cxr library procedure
These twenty-four procedures are further compositions of
car and cdr on the same principles. For example, caddr
could be defined by
(define caddr (lambda (x) (car (cdr (cdr x))))).
Arbitrary compositions up to four deep are provided.
(null? obj ) procedure
Returns #t if obj is the empty list, otherwise returns #f.
(list? obj ) procedure
Returns #t if obj is a list. Otherwise, it returns #f. By
definition, all lists have finite length and are terminated by
the empty list.
(list? '(a b c)) ==> #t
(list? '()) ==> #t
(list? '(a . b)) ==> #f
(let ((x (list 'a)))
(set-cdr! x x)
(list? x)) ==> #f
(make-list k) procedure
(make-list k fill) procedure
Returns a newly allocated list of k elements. If a second
argument is given, then each element is initialized to fill .
Otherwise the initial contents of each element is unspeci-
fied.
(make-list 2 3) ==> (3 3)
(list obj : : : ) procedure
Returns a newly allocated list of its arguments.
(list 'a (+ 3 4) 'c) ==> (a 7 c)
(list) ==> ()
(length list) procedure
Returns the length of list .
(length '(a b c)) ==> 3
(length '(a (b) (c d e))) ==> 3
(length '()) ==> 0
(append list : : : ) procedure
The last argument, if there is one, can be of any type.
Returns a list consisting of the elements of the first list
followed by the elements of the other list s. If there are no
arguments, the empty list is returned. If there is exactly
one argument, it is returned. Otherwise the resulting list
is always newly allocated, except that it shares structure
with the last argument. An improper list results if the last
argument is not a proper list.
(append '(x) '(y)) ==> (x y)
(append '(a) '(b c d)) ==> (a b c d)
(append '(a (b)) '((c))) ==> (a (b) (c))
(append '(a b) '(c . d)) ==> (a b c . d)
(append '() 'a) ==> a
(reverse list) procedure
Returns a newly allocated list consisting of the elements of
list in reverse order.
(reverse '(a b c)) ==> (c b a)
(reverse '(a (b c) d (e (f))))
==> ((e (f)) d (b c) a)
(list-tail list k) procedure
It is an error if list has fewer than k elements.
Returns the sublist of list obtained by omitting the first k
elements. The list-tail procedure could be defined by
(define list-tail
(lambda (x k)
(if (zero? k)
x
(list-tail (cdr x) (- k 1)))))
(list-ref list k) procedure
The list argument can be circular, but it is an error if list has
fewer than k elements.
Returns the kth element of list . (This is the same as the
car of (list-tail list k).)
6. Standard procedures 43
(list-ref '(a b c d) 2) ==> c
(list-ref '(a b c d)
(exact (round 1.8)))
==> c
(list-set! list k obj ) procedure
It is an error if k is not a valid index of list .
The list-set! procedure stores obj in element k of
list .
(let ((ls (list 'one 'two 'five!)))
(list-set! ls 2 'three)
ls)
==> (one two three)
(list-set! '(0 1 2) 1 "oops")
==> error ; constant list
(memq obj list) procedure
(memv obj list) procedure
(member obj list) procedure
(member obj list compare) procedure
These procedures return the first sublist of list whose car
is obj , where the sublists of list are the non-empty lists
returned by (list-tail list k) for k less than the length
of list . If obj does not occur in list , then #f (not the empty
list) is returned. The memq procedure uses eq? to compare
obj with the elements of list , while memv uses eqv? and
member uses compare, if given, and equal? otherwise.
(memq 'a '(a b c)) ==> (a b c)
(memq 'b '(a b c)) ==> (b c)
(memq 'a '(b c d)) ==> #f
(memq (list 'a) '(b (a) c)) ==> #f
(member (list 'a)
'(b (a) c)) ==> ((a) c)
(member "B"
'("a" "b" "c")
string-ci=?) ==> ("b" "c")
(memq 101 '(100 101 102)) ==> unspecified
(memv 101 '(100 101 102)) ==> (101 102)
(assq obj alist) procedure
(assv obj alist) procedure
(assoc obj alist) procedure
(assoc obj alist compare) procedure
It is an error if alist (for \association list") is not a list of pairs.
These procedures find the first pair in alist whose car field
is obj , and returns that pair. If no pair in alist has obj
as its car, then #f (not the empty list) is returned. The
assq procedure uses eq? to compare obj with the car fields
of the pairs in alist , while assv uses eqv? and assoc uses
compare if given and equal? otherwise.
(define e '((a 1) (b 2) (c 3)))
(assq 'a e) ==> (a 1)
(assq 'b e) ==> (b 2)
(assq 'd e) ==> #f
(assq (list 'a) '(((a)) ((b)) ((c))))
==> #f
(assoc (list 'a) '(((a)) ((b)) ((c))))
==> ((a))
(assoc 2.0 '((1 1) (2 4) (3 9)) ==>
==> (2 4)
(assq 5 '((2 3) (5 7) (11 13)))
==> unspecified
(assv 5 '((2 3) (5 7) (11 13)))
==> (5 7)
Rationale: Although they are often used as predicates, memq,
memv, member, assq, assv, and assoc do not have question
marks in their names because they return potentially useful
values rather than just #t or #f.
(list-copy obj ) procedure
Returns a newly allocated copy of the given obj if it is a
list. Only the pairs themselves are copied; the cars of the
result are the same (in the sense of eqv?) as the cars of list .
If obj is an improper list, so is the result, and the final cdrs
are the same in the sense of eqv?. An obj which is not a
list is returned unchanged. It is an error if obj is a circular
list.
(define a '(1 8 2 8)) ; a may be immutable
(define b (list-copy a))
(set-car! b 3) ; b is mutable
b ==> (3 8 2 8)
a ==> (1 8 2 8)
