<EM>Syntax</EM>
All of init, step, test, and command
are expressions.
<P>
<EM>Semantics: </EM>
A <code>do</code> expression is an iteration construct.  It specifies a set of variables to
be bound, how they are to be initialized at the start, and how they are
to be updated on each iteration.  When a termination condition is met,
the loop exits after evaluating the expressions.
</P>
<P>
A <code>do</code> expression is evaluated as follows:
The init expressions are evaluated (in some unspecified order),
the variables are bound to fresh locations, the results of the
init expressions are stored in the bindings of the
variables, and then the iteration phase begins.
</P>
<P>
Each iteration begins by evaluating test; if the result is
false (see section&nbsp;<A HREF="node72.html#booleansection">6.3</A>), then the command
expressions are evaluated in order for effect, the step
expressions are evaluated in some unspecified order, the
variables are bound to fresh locations, the results of the
steps are stored in the bindings of the
variables, and the next iteration begins.
</P>
<P>
If test evaluates to a true value, then the
expressions are evaluated from left to right and the values of
the last expression are returned.  If no expressions
are present, then the value of the <code>do</code> expression is unspecified.
</P>
<P>
The region of the binding of a variable
consists of the entire <code>do</code> expression except for the inits.
It is an error for a variable to appear more than once in the
list of <code>do</code> variables.
</P>
<P>
A step can be omitted, in which case the effect is the
same as if <code>(variable init variable)</code> had
been written instead of <code>(variable init)</code>.

<EM>Semantics: </EM>
"Named <code>let</code>" is a variant on the syntax of <code>let</code> which provides
a more general looping construct than <code>do</code> and can also be used to express
recursion.
It has the same syntax and semantics as ordinary <code>let</code>
except that variable is bound within body to a procedure
whose formal arguments are the bound variables and whose body is
body.  Thus the execution of body can be repeated by
invoking the procedure named by variable.
