A transformer spec has one of the following forms:
</P>
<P>
<div id="syntax-rules" class="obj-box">
  <div class="obj-header">
    <span class="code">(syntax-rules </span>
    <span class="code-var">({literal} ...) {syntax-rule} ...</span>
    <span class="code">)</span>
    <span class="obj-type">syntax</span>
  </div>
  <div class="obj-header">
    <span class="code">(syntax-rules </span>
    <span class="code-var">({ellipsis} {literal} ...) {syntax-rule} ...</span>
    <span class="code">)</span>
    <span class="obj-type">syntax</span>
  </div>
  <div class="obj-header">
    <span class="code">_</span>
    <span class="obj-type">auxiliary syntax</span>
  </div>
  <div class="obj-header">
    <span class="code">...</span>
    <span class="obj-type">auxiliary syntax</span>
  </div>
</div>
</p>
<P>
<EM>Syntax: </EM>
It is an error if any of the literals, or the ellipsis in the second form,
is not an identifier.
It is also an error if
syntax rule is not of the form
</p>
<P>
<div class="code-block">
({pattern} {template})
</div>
</p>
<P>
The pattern in a syntax rule is a list pattern
whose first element is an identifier.
</P>
<P>
A pattern is either an identifier, a constant, or one of the
following
</P>
<P>
<div class="code-block">
({pattern} ...)
({pattern} {pattern} ... . {pattern})
({pattern} ... {pattern} {ellipsis} {pattern} ...)
({pattern} ... {pattern} {ellipsis} {pattern} ...
    . {pattern})
#({pattern} ...)
#({pattern} ... {pattern} {ellipsis} {pattern} ...)
</div>
</p>
<P>
and a template is either an identifier, a constant, or one of the following
</P>
<P>
<div class="code-block">
({element} ...)
({element} {element} ... . {template})
({ellipsis} {template})
#({element} ...)
</div>
</p>
<P>
where an element is a template optionally
followed by an ellipsis.
An ellipsis is the identifier specified in the second form
of <code>syntax-rules</code>, or the default identifier <code>...</code>
(three consecutive periods) otherwise.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Semantics: </EM>An instance of <code>syntax-rules</code> produces a new macro
transformer by specifying a sequence of hygienic rewrite rules.  A use
of a macro whose keyword is associated with a transformer specified by
<code>syntax-rules</code> is matched against the patterns contained in the
syntax rules, beginning with the leftmost syntax rule.
When a match is found, the macro use is transcribed hygienically
according to the template.
</P>
<P>
An identifier appearing within a pattern can be an underscore
(<code>_</code>), a literal identifier listed in the list of literals,
or the ellipsis.
All other identifiers appearing within a pattern are
<EM>pattern variables</EM>.
</P>
<P>
The keyword at the beginning of the pattern in a
syntax rule is not involved in the matching and
is considered neither a pattern variable nor a literal identifier.
</P>
<P>
Pattern variables match arbitrary input elements and
are used to refer to elements of the input in the template.
It is an error for the same pattern variable to appear more than once in a
pattern.
</P>
<P>
Underscores also match arbitrary input elements but are not pattern variables
and so cannot be used to refer to those elements.  If an underscore appears
in the literals list, then that takes precedence and
underscores in the pattern match as literals.
Multiple underscores can appear in a pattern.
</P>
<P>
Identifiers that appear in <code>({literal} ...)</code> are
interpreted as literal
identifiers to be matched against corresponding elements of the input.
An element in the input matches a literal identifier if and only if it is an
identifier and either both its occurrence in the macro expression and its
occurrence in the macro definition have the same lexical binding, or
the two identifiers are the same and both have no lexical binding.
</P>
<P>
A subpattern followed by ellipsis can match zero or more elements of
the input, unless ellipsis appears in the literals, in which
case it is matched as a literal.
</P>
<P>
More formally, an input expression E matches a pattern P if and only if:
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
 P is an underscore (<code>_</code>).
</LI>
<LI>
 P is a non-literal identifier; or
</LI>
<LI>
 P is a literal identifier and
 E is an identifier with the same
      binding; or
</LI>
<LI>
 P is a list (P1 ... Pn) and E is a list of n elements
 that match P1 through Pn, respectively; or 
</LI>
<LI>
 P is an improper list (P1 P2 ... Pn . Pn+1)
 and E is a list or improper list of n or more elements
 that match P1 though Pn respectively, and whose nth tail
 matches Pn+1; or
</LI>
<LI>
P is of the form (P1 ... Pk Pe {ellipsis} Pm+1 ... Pn)
where E is a proper list of n elements, the first
k of which match P1 through Pk, respectively, whose
next m..k elements each match Pe, whose remaining
n .. m elements match Pm+1 through Pn; or
</LI>
<LI>
P is of the form (P1 ... Pk Pe hellipsisi Pm+1 ...
Pn . Px) where E is a list or improper list of n elements,
the first k of which match P1 through Pk,
whose next m .. k elements each match Pe, whose remaining
n..m elements match Pm+1 through Pn, and
whose nth and final cdr matches Px; or
</LI>
<LI>
P is a vector of the form #(P1 ... Pn) and E is a
vector of n elements that match P1 through Pn; or
</LI>
<LI>
P is of the form #(P1 ... Pk Pe hellipsisi Pm+1
... Pn) where E is a vector of n elements the first
k of which match P1 through Pk, whose next m .. k
elements each match Pe, and whose remaining n .. m
elements match Pm+1 through Pn; or
</LI>
<LI>
 P is a constant and E is equal to P
 in the sense of the <code>equal?</code> procedure.
</LI>
</UL>
</p>
<P>
It is an error to use a macro keyword, within the scope of its
binding, in an expression that does not match any of the patterns.
</P>
<P>
When a macro use is transcribed according to the template of the
matching syntax rule, pattern variables that occur in the
template are replaced by the elements they match in the input.
Pattern variables that occur in subpatterns followed by one or more
instances of the identifier
ellipsis are allowed only in subtemplates that are
followed by as many instances of ellipsis.
They are replaced in the
output by all of the elements they match in the input, distributed as
indicated.  It is an error if the output cannot be built up as
specified.
</P>
<P>
Identifiers that appear in the template but are not pattern variables
or the identifier
ellipsis are inserted into the output as literal identifiers.  If a
literal identifier is inserted as a free identifier then it refers to the
binding of that identifier within whose scope the instance of
<code>syntax-rules</code> appears.
If a literal identifier is inserted as a bound identifier then it is
in effect renamed to prevent inadvertent captures of free identifiers.
</P>
<P>
A template of the form
<code>(ellipsis template)</code> is identical to template,
except that
ellipses within the template have no special meaning.
That is, any ellipses contained within template are
treated as ordinary identifiers.
In particular, the template <code>(ellipsis ellipsis)</code> produces
a single ellipsis.
This allows syntactic abstractions to expand into code containing
ellipses.
</P>
<P>
<div class="code-block">
(define-syntax be-like-begin
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((be-like-begin name)
      (define-syntax name
        (syntax-rules ()
          ((name expr (... ...))
            (begin expr (... ...))))))))
(be-like-begin sequence)
(sequence 1 2 3 4)      ==&gt; 4
</div>
</p>
<P>
As an example, if <code>let</code> and <code>cond</code> are defined as in
section&nbsp;<A HREF="node96.html#derivedsection">7.3</A> then they are hygienic (as required) and
the following is not an error.
</P>
<P>
<div class="code-block">
(let ((=&gt; #f))
  (cond (#t =&gt; 'ok)))    ==&gt; ok
</div>
</p>
The macro transformer for <code>cond</code> recognizes <code>=&gt;</code>
as a local variable, and hence an expression, and not as the
base identifier <code>=&gt;</code>, which the macro transformer treats
as a syntactic keyword.  Thus the example expands into
</P>
<P>
<div class="code-block">
(let ((=&gt; #f))
  (if #t (begin =&gt; 'ok)))
</div>
</p>
<P>
instead of
</p>
<p>
<div class="code-block">
(let ((=&gt; #f))
  (let ((temp #t))
    (if temp ('ok temp))))
</div>
</p>
<p>
which would result in an invalid procedure call.
