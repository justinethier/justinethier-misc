Vectors are heterogeneous structures whose elements are
indexed by integers. A vector typically occupies less space
than a list of the same length, and the average time needed
to access a randomly chosen element is typically less for the
vector than for the list.
The length of a vector is the number of elements that it
contains. This number is a non-negative integer that is
xed when the vector is created. The valid indexes of a
vector are the exact non-negative integers less than the
length of the vector. The rst element in a vector is indexed
by zero, and the last element is indexed by one less than
the length of the vector.
Vectors are written using the notation #(obj : : : ). For
example, a vector of length 3 containing the number zero
in element 0, the list (2 2 2 2) in element 1, and the
string "Anna" in element 2 can be written as follows:
#(0 (2 2 2 2) "Anna")
Vector constants are self-evaluating, so they do not need
to be quoted in programs.
(vector? obj ) procedure
Returns #t if obj is a vector; otherwise returns #f.
(make-vector k) procedure
(make-vector k ll) procedure
Returns a newly allocated vector of k elements. If a second
argument is given, then each element is initialized to ll .
Otherwise the initial contents of each element is unspeci-
ed.
(vector obj : : : ) procedure
Returns a newly allocated vector whose elements contain
the given arguments. It is analogous to list.
(vector 'a 'b 'c) =) #(a b c)
(vector-length vector) procedure
Returns the number of elements in vector as an exact integer.
(vector-ref vector k) procedure
It is an error if k is not a valid index of vector.
The vector-ref procedure returns the contents of element
k of vector.
(vector-ref '#(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21)
5)
=) 8
(vector-ref '#(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21)
(exact
(round (* 2 (acos -1)))))
=) 13
(vector-set! vector k obj ) procedure
It is an error if k is not a valid index of vector.
The vector-set! procedure stores obj in element k of
vector.
(let ((vec (vector 0 '(2 2 2 2) "Anna")))
(vector-set! vec 1 '("Sue" "Sue"))
vec)
=) #(0 ("Sue" "Sue") "Anna")
(vector-set! '#(0 1 2) 1 "doe")
=) error ; constant vector
(vector->list vector) procedure
(vector->list vector start) procedure
(vector->list vector start end) procedure
(list->vector list) procedure
The vector->list procedure returns a newly allocated list
of the objects contained in the elements of vector between
start and end. The list->vector procedure returns a
newly created vector initialized to the elements of the list
list .
In both procedures, order is preserved.
(vector->list '#(dah dah didah))
=) (dah dah didah)
(vector->list '#(dah dah didah) 1 2)
=) (dah)
(list->vector '(dididit dah))
=) #(dididit dah)
(vector->string vector) procedure
(vector->string vector start) procedure
(vector->string vector start end) procedure
(string->vector string) procedure
6. Standard procedures 49
(string->vector string start) procedure
(string->vector string start end) procedure
It is an error if any element of vector between start and end is
not a character.
The vector->string procedure returns a newly allocated
string of the objects contained in the elements of vector
between start and end. The string->vector procedure
returns a newly created vector initialized to the elements
of the string string between start and end.
In both procedures, order is preserved.
(string->vector "ABC") =) #(#\A #\B #\C)
(vector->string
#(#\1 #\2 #\3) =) "123"
(vector-copy vector) procedure
(vector-copy vector start) procedure
(vector-copy vector start end) procedure
Returns a newly allocated copy of the elements of the given
vector between start and end. The elements of the new
vector are the same (in the sense of eqv?) as the elements
of the old.
(define a #(1 8 2 8)) ; a may be immutable
(define b (vector-copy a))
(vector-set! b 0 3) ; b is mutable
b =) #(3 8 2 8)
(define c (vector-copy b 1 3))
c =) #(8 2)
(vector-copy! to at from) procedure
(vector-copy! to at from start) procedure
(vector-copy! to at from start end) procedure
It is an error if at is less than zero or greater than the length
of to. It is also an error if (- (vector-length to) at) is less
than (- end start).
Copies the elements of vector from between start and end
to vector to, starting at at. The order in which elements
are copied is unspecied, except that if the source and destination
overlap, copying takes place as if the source is rst
copied into a temporary vector and then into the destination.
This can be achieved without allocating storage by
making sure to copy in the correct direction in such circumstances.
(define a (vector 1 2 3 4 5))
(define b (vector 10 20 30 40 50))
(vector-copy! b 1 a 0 2)
b =) #(10 1 2 40 50)
(vector-append vector : : : ) procedure
Returns a newly allocated vector whose elements are the
concatenation of the elements of the given vectors.
(vector-append #(a b c) #(d e f))
=) #(a b c d e f)
(vector-fill! vector ll) procedure
(vector-fill! vector ll start) procedure
(vector-fill! vector ll start end) procedure
The vector-fill! procedure stores ll in the elements of
vector between start and end.
(define a (vector 1 2 3 4 5))
(vector-fill! a 'smash 2 4)
a
=) #(1 2 smash smash 5)
