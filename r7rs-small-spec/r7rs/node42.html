<EM>Syntax: </EM>
Each cond clause is as in the specification of <code>cond</code>.
<P>
<EM>Semantics: </EM>
The body is evaluated with an exception
handler that binds the raised object (see <code>raise</code> in section&nbsp;<A HREF="node80.html#exceptionsection">6.11</A>)
to variable and, within the scope of
that binding, evaluates the clauses as if they were the clauses of a
<code>cond</code> expression. That implicit <code>cond</code> expression is evaluated with the
continuation and dynamic environment of the <code>guard</code> expression. If every
cond clause's test evaluates to <code>#f</code> and there
is no else clause, then
<code>raise-continuable</code> is invoked on the raised object within the dynamic
environment of the original call to <code>raise</code>
or <code>raise-continuable</code>, except that the current
exception handler is that of the <code>guard</code> expression.
</P>

See section&nbsp;<A HREF="node80.html#exceptionsection">6.11</A> for a more complete discussion of
exceptions.
