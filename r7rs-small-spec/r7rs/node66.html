<p>
It is useful to distinguish between numbers that are represented
exactly and those that might not be. For example,
indexes into data structures must be known exactly, as
must some polynomial coefficients in a symbolic algebra
system. On the other hand, the results of measurements
are inherently inexact, and irrational numbers may be approximated
by rational and therefore inexact approximations.
In order to catch uses of inexact numbers where exact
numbers are required, Scheme explicitly distinguishes
exact from inexact numbers. This distinction is orthogonal
to the dimension of type.
</p>
<p>
A Scheme number is exact if it was written as an exact
constant or was derived from exact numbers using only exact
operations. A number is inexact if it was written as
an inexact constant, if it was derived using inexact ingredients,
or if it was derived using inexact operations. Thus
inexactness is a contagious property of a number. In particular,
an exact complex number has an exact real part
and an exact imaginary part; all other complex numbers
are inexact complex numbers.
</p>
<p>
If two implementations produce exact results for a computation
that did not involve inexact intermediate results, the
two ultimate results will be mathematically equal. This
is generally not true of computations involving inexact
numbers since approximate methods such as floating-point
arithmetic may be used, but it is the duty of each implementation
to make the result as close as practical to the
mathematically ideal result.
</p>
<p>
Rational operations such as + should always produce exact
results when given exact arguments. If the operation
is unable to produce an exact result, then it may either
report the violation of an implementation restriction or it
may silently coerce its result to an inexact value. However,
(/ 3 4) must not return the mathematically incorrect
value 0. See section 6.2.3.
</p>
<p>
Except for exact, the operations described in this section
must generally return inexact results when given any inexact
arguments. An operation may, however, return an
exact result if it can prove that the value of the result is
unaffected by the inexactness of its arguments. For example,
multiplication of any number by an exact zero may
produce an exact zero result, even if the other argument is
inexact.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, the expression (* 0 +inf.0) may return 0, or
+nan.0, or report that inexact numbers are not supported,
or report that non-rational real numbers are not supported,
or fail silently or noisily in other implementation-specific
ways.
