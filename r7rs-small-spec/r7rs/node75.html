Characters are objects that represent printed characters
such as letters and digits. All Scheme implementations
must support at least the ASCII character repertoire: that
is, Unicode characters U+0000 through U+007F. Implementations
may support any other Unicode characters they
see fit, and may also support non-Unicode characters as
well. Except as otherwise specified, the result of applying
any of the following procedures to a non-Unicode character
is implementation-dependent.
Characters are written using the notation #\hcharacteri or
#\hcharacter namei or #\xhhex scalar valuei.
The following character names must be supported by all
implementations with the given values. Implementations
may add other names provided they cannot be interpreted
as hex scalar values preceded by x.
#\alarm ; U+0007
#\backspace ; U+0008
#\delete ; U+007F
#\escape ; U+001B
#\newline ; the linefeed character, U+000A
#\null ; the null character, U+0000
#\return ; the return character, U+000D
#\space ; the preferred way to write a space
#\tab ; the tab character, U+0009
Here are some additional examples:
#\a ; lower case letter
#\A ; upper case letter
#\( ; left parenthesis
#\ ; the space character
 (if character is supported)
#\iota ;  (if character and name are supported)
Case is significant in #\hcharacteri, and in #\hcharacter
namei, but not in #\xhhex scalar valuei. If hcharacteri
in #\hcharacteri is alphabetic, then any character immediately
following hcharacteri cannot be one that can appear
in an identifier. This rule resolves the ambiguous case
where, for example, the sequence of characters \#\space"
could be taken to be either a representation of the space
character or a representation of the character \#\s" followed
by a representation of the symbol \pace."
Characters written in the #\ notation are self-evaluating.
That is, they do not have to be quoted in programs.
Some of the procedures that operate on characters ignore
the diã„¦ence between upper case and lower case. The procedures
that ignore case have \-ci" (for \case insensitive")
embedded in their names.
(char? obj ) procedure
Returns #t if obj is a character, otherwise returns #f.
(char=? char1 char2 char3 : : : ) procedure
(char<? char1 char2 char3 : : : ) procedure
6. Standard procedures 45
(char>? char1 char2 char3 : : : ) procedure
(char<=? char1 char2 char3 : : : ) procedure
(char>=? char1 char2 char3 : : : ) procedure
These procedures return #t if the results of passing their
arguments to char->integer are respectively equal, monotonically
increasing, monotonically decreasing, monotonically
non-decreasing, or monotonically non-increasing.
These predicates are required to be transitive.
(char-ci=? char1 char2 char3 : : : )
char library procedure
(char-ci<? char1 char2 char3 : : : )
char library procedure
(char-ci>? char1 char2 char3 : : : )
char library procedure
(char-ci<=? char1 char2 char3 : : : )
char library procedure
(char-ci>=? char1 char2 char3 : : : )
char library procedure
These procedures are similar to char=? et cetera, but they
treat upper case and lower case letters as the same. For
example, (char-ci=? #\A #\a) returns #t.
Specifically, these procedures behave as if char-foldcase
were applied to their arguments before they were compared.
(char-alphabetic? char) char library procedure
(char-numeric? char) char library procedure
(char-whitespace? char) char library procedure
(char-upper-case? letter) char library procedure
(char-lower-case? letter) char library procedure
These procedures return #t if their arguments are alphabetic,
numeric, whitespace, upper case, or lower case characters,
respectively, otherwise they return #f.
Specifically, they must return #t when applied to characters
with the Unicode properties Alphabetic, Numeric
Digit, White Space, Uppercase, and Lowercase respectively,
and #f when applied to any other Unicode characters.
Note that many Unicode characters are alphabetic
but neither upper nor lower case.
(digit-value char) char library procedure
This procedure returns the numeric value (0 to 9) of its
argument if it is a numeric digit (that is, if char-numeric?
returns #t), or #f on any other character.
(digit-value #\3) ==> 3
(digit-value #\x0664) ==> 4
(digit-value #\x0AE6) ==> 0
(digit-value #\x0EA6) ==> #f
(char->integer char) procedure
(integer->char n) procedure
Given a Unicode character, char->integer returns an exact
integer between 0 and #xD7FF or between #xE000 and
#x10FFFF which is equal to the Unicode scalar value of
that character. Given a non-Unicode character, it returns
an exact integer greater than #x10FFFF. This is true independent
of whether the implementation uses the Unicode
representation internally.
Given an exact integer that is the value returned by a character
when char->integer is applied to it, integer->char
returns that character.
(char-upcase char) char library procedure
(char-downcase char) char library procedure
(char-foldcase char) char library procedure
The char-upcase procedure, given an argument that is
the lowercase part of a Unicode casing pair, returns the
uppercase member of the pair, provided that both characters
are supported by the Scheme implementation. Note
that language-sensitive casing pairs are not used. If the
argument is not the lowercase member of such a pair, it is
returned.
The char-downcase procedure, given an argument that is
the uppercase part of a Unicode casing pair, returns the
lowercase member of the pair, provided that both characters
are supported by the Scheme implementation. Note
that language-sensitive casing pairs are not used. If the
argument is not the uppercase member of such a pair, it is
returned.
The char-foldcase procedure applies the Unicode simple
case-folding algorithm to its argument and returns the result.
Note that language-sensitive folding is not used. If
the argument is an uppercase letter, the result will be either
a lowercase letter or the same as the argument if the
lowercase letter does not exist or is not supported by the
implementation. See UAX #29 [11] (part of the Unicode
Standard) for details.
Note that many Unicode lowercase characters do not have
uppercase equivalents.
