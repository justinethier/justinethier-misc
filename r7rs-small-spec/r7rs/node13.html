<P>
The symbol "==&gt;" used in program examples is read "evaluates to". For example:
</p>
<p>
<div class="code-block">
(* 5 8)    ==&gt; 40
</div>
</p>
<P>
means that the expression <span class="code">(* 5 8)</span> evaluates to the object <span class="code">40</span>.
Or, more precisely:  the expression given by the sequence of characters
"<span class="code">(* 5 8)</span>" evaluates, in the initial environment, to an object
that can be represented externally by the sequence of characters "<span class="code">40</span>."  See section&nbsp;<A HREF="node23.html#externalreps">3.3</A> for a discussion of external
representations of objects.
