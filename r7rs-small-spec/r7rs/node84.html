If port is omitted from any input procedure, it defaults
to the value returned by (current-input-port). It is an
error to attempt an input operation on a closed port.

The read procedure converts external representations of
Scheme objects into the objects themselves. That is, it is
a parser for the non-terminal {datum} (see section
6.4). It returns the next object parsable from the
given textual input port, updating port to point to the
first character past the end of the external representation
of the object.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <br />
Implementations may support extended syntax to represent
record types or other types that do not have datum
representations.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <br />
If an end of file is encountered in the input before any
characters are found that can begin an object, then an
end-of-file object is returned. The port remains open, and
further attempts to read will also return an end-of-file object.
If an end of file is encountered after the beginning of
an object's external representation, but the external representation
is incomplete and therefore not parsable, an error
that satisfies read-error? is signaled.

port, but without updating the port to point to the
following character. If no more characters are available, an
end-of-file object is returned.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <br />
Note: The value returned by a call to peek-char is the same as
the value that would have been returned by a call to read-char
with the same port. The only diã„¦ence is that the very next call
to read-char or peek-char on that port will return the value
returned by the preceding call to peek-char. In particular, a
call to peek-char on an interactive port will hang waiting for
input whenever a call to read-char would have hung.

  </div>
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
Returns the next line of text available from the textual
input port, updating the port to point to the following
character. If an end of line is read, a string containing all
of the text up to (but not including) the end of line is returned,
and the port is updated to point just past the end
of line. If an end of file is encountered before any end of
line is read, but some characters have been read, a string
containing those characters is returned. If an end of file is
encountered before any characters are read, an end-of-file
object is returned. For the purpose of this procedure, an
end of line consists of either a linefeed character, a carriage
58 Revised7 Scheme
followed by a linefeed character. Implementations may
also recognize other end of line characters or sequences.

  <div class="p"><!----></div>
Returns #t if a character is ready on the textual input
port and returns #f otherwise. If char-ready returns #t
then the next read-char operation on the given port is
guaranteed not to hang. If the port is at end of file then
char-ready? returns #t.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <br />
Rationale: The char-ready? procedure exists to make it pos-
sible for a program to accept characters from interactive ports
without getting stuck waiting for input. Any input editors as-
sociated with such ports must ensure that characters whose
existence has been asserted by char-ready? cannot be removed
from the input. If char-ready? were to return #f at end of
file, a port at end of file would be indistinguishable from an
interactive port that has no ready characters.
