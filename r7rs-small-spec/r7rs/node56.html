<P>
Syntax definitions have this form:
</P>
<P>
<div class="code-block">
(define-syntax keyword transformer spec)
</div>
</P>
<P>
Keyword is an identifier, and
the transformer spec is an instance of <code>syntax-rules</code>.
Like variable definitions, syntax definitions can appear at the outermost level or
nested within a <code>body</code>.
</P>
<P>
If the <code>define-syntax</code> occurs at the outermost level, then the global
syntactic environment is extended by binding the
keyword to the specified transformer, but previous expansions
of any global binding for keyword remain unchanged.
Otherwise, it is an <EM>internal syntax definition</EM>, and is local to the
body in which it is defined.
Any use of a syntax keyword before its corresponding definition is an error.
In particular, a use that precedes an inner definition will not apply an outer
definition.
</P>
<P>
<div class="code-block">
(let ((x 1) (y 2))
  (define-syntax swap!
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((swap! a b)
        (let ((tmp a))
          (set! a b)
          (set! b tmp)))))
  (swap! x y)
  (list x y))       ==&gt; (2 1)
</div>
</p>
<P>
Macros can expand into definitions in any context that permits
them. However, it is an error for a definition to define an
identifier whose binding has to be known in order to determine the meaning of the
definition itself, or of any preceding definition that belongs to the
same group of internal definitions. Similarly, it is an error for an
internal definition to define an identifier whose binding has to be known
in order
to determine the boundary between the internal definitions and the
expressions of the body it belongs to. For example, the following are
errors:

             body ...))))))
  (let ((x 3))
    (foo (plus x y) (+ x y))
    (define foo x)
    (plus foo x)))
