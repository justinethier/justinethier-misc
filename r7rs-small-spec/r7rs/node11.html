<P>
When speaking of an error situation, this report uses the phrase "an
error is signaled" to indicate that Husk will detect and
report the error.
An error is signaled by raising a non-continuable exception, as if by
the procedure <span class="code">raise</span> as described in section&nbsp;<A HREF="node80.html#exceptionsection">6.11</A>.  The object raised is implementation-dependent
and need not be distinct from objects previously used for the same purpose.
In addition to errors signaled in situations described in this
report, programmers can signal their own errors and handle signaled errors.
</P>
<P>
The phrase "an error that satisfies <EM>predicate</EM> is signaled" means that an error is
signaled as above.  Furthermore, if the object that is signaled is
passed to the specified predicate (such as <span class="code">file-error?</span> or <span class="code">read-error?</span>), the predicate returns <span class="code">#t</span>.
</p>

<P>
If such wording does not appear in the discussion of
an error, then implementations are not required to detect or report the
error, though they are encouraged to do so.
Such a situation is sometimes, but not always, referred to with the phrase
"an error."
In such a situation, an implementation may or may not signal an error;
if it does signal an error, the object that is signaled may or may not
satisfy the predicates <span class="code">error-object?</span>, <span class="code">file-error?</span>, or
<span class="code">read-error?</span>.
Alternatively, implementations may provide non-portable extensions.
</p>
<P>
For example, it is an error for a procedure to be passed an argument of a type that
the procedure is not explicitly specified to handle, even though such
domain errors are seldom mentioned in this report.  Implementations may
signal an error,
extend a procedure's domain of definition to include such arguments,
or fail catastrophically.
</p>
<P>
This report uses the phrase "may report a violation of an
implementation restriction" to indicate circumstances under which an
implementation is permitted to report that it is unable to continue
execution of a correct program because of some restriction imposed by the
implementation.  Implementation restrictions are discouraged,
but implementations are encouraged to report violations of implementation
restrictions.
</p>
<P>
For example, an implementation may report a violation of an
implementation restriction if it does not have enough storage to run a
program,
or if an arithmetic operation would produce an exact number that is
too large for the implementation to represent.
</p>
<P>
If the value of an expression is said to be "unspecified," then
the expression must evaluate to some object without signaling an error,
but the value depends on the implementation; this report explicitly does
not say what value is returned.
</p>
<P>
Finally, the words and phrases "must," "must not," "shall,"
"shall not," "should," "should not," "may," "required,"
"recommended," and "optional," although not capitalized in this
report, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [<A
 HREF="node105.html#rfc2119">3</A>].
They are used only with reference to implementer or implementation behavior,
not with reference to programmer or program behavior.
