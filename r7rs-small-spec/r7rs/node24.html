JAE TODO: this section is not good enough, and needs a major
overhaul for husk


<P>
Variables and objects such as pairs, strings, vectors, and bytevectors implicitly
denote locations or sequences of locations.  A string, for
example, denotes as many locations as there are characters in the string. 
A new value can be
stored into one of these locations using the <code>string-set!</code> procedure, but
the string continues to denote the same locations as before.
</P>
<P>
An object fetched from a location, by a variable reference or by
a procedure such as <code>car</code>, <code>vector-ref</code>, or <code>string-ref</code>, is
equivalent in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>
(section&nbsp;<A HREF="node63.html#equivalencesection">6.1</A>)
to the object last stored in the location before the fetch.
</P>
<P>
Every location is marked to show whether it is in use.
No variable or object ever refers to a location that is not in use.
</P>
<P>
Whenever this report speaks of storage being newly allocated for a variable
or object, what is meant is that an appropriate number of locations are
chosen from the set of locations that are not in use, and the chosen
locations are marked to indicate that they are now in use before the variable
or object is made to denote them.
Notwithstanding this,
it is understood that the empty list cannot be newly allocated, because
it is a unique object.  It is also understood that empty strings, empty
vectors, and empty bytevectors, which contain no locations, may or may
not be newly allocated.
</P>
<P>
Every object that denotes locations is 
either mutable or
immutable.  Literal constants, the strings
returned by <code>symbol-&gt;string</code>,
and possibly the environment returned by <code>scheme-report-environment</code>
are immutable objects.  All objects
created by the other procedures listed in this report are mutable.
It is an
error to attempt to store a new value into a location that is denoted by an
immutable object.
</P>
<P>
These locations are to be understood as conceptual, not physical.
Hence, they do not necessarily correspond to memory addresses,
and even if they do, the memory address might not be constant.
</P>
<P>
In many systems it is desirable for constants (i.e. the values of
literal expressions) to reside in read-only memory.
Making it an error to alter constants permits this implementation strategy,
while not requiring other systems to distinguish between
mutable and immutable objects.
