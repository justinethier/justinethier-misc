<P>
A predicate is a procedure that always returns a boolean
value (#t or #f). An equivalence predicate is the computational
analogue of a mathematical equivalence relation;
it is symmetric, reflexive, and transitive. Of the equivalence
predicates described in this section, eq? is the finest
or most discriminating, equal? is the coarsest, and eqv?
is slightly less discriminating than eq?.

The eqv? procedure defines a useful equivalence relation on
objects. Briefly, it returns #t if obj1 and obj2 are normally
regarded as the same object. This relation is left slightly
open to interpretation, but the following partial specification
of eqv? holds for all implementations of Scheme.
The eqv? procedure returns #t if:
<div class="p"> &nbsp; </div>
<ul>
<li>
obj1 and obj2 are both #t or both #f.
</li>
<li>
obj1 and obj2 are both symbols and are the same symbol
according to the symbol=? procedure (section 6.5).
</li>
<li>
obj1 and obj2 are both exact numbers and are numerically
equal (in the sense of ==&gt;.
</li>
<li>
obj1 and obj2 are both inexact numbers such that they
are numerically equal (in the sense of ==&gt; and they yield
the same results (in the sense of eqv?) when passed as
arguments to any other procedure that can be defined
as a finite composition of Scheme's standard arithmetic
procedures, provided it does not result in a NaN
value.
</li>
<li>
obj1 and obj2 are both characters and are the same
character according to the char=? procedure (section
6.6).
</li>
<li>
obj1 and obj2 are both the empty list.
</li>
<li>
obj1 and obj2 are pairs, vectors, bytevectors, records,
or strings that denote the same location in the store
(section 3.4).
</li>
<li>
obj1 and obj2 are procedures whose location tags are
equal (section 4.1.4).
</li>
</ul>
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
The eqv? procedure returns #f if:
<ul>
<li>
obj1 and obj2 are of different types (section 3.2).
</li>
<li>
one of obj1 and obj2 is #t but the other is #f.
</li>
<li>

obj1 and obj2 are symbols but are not the same symbol
according to the symbol=? procedure (section 6.5).
</li>
<li>

one of obj1 and obj2 is an exact number but the other
is an inexact number.
</li>
<li>

obj1 and obj2 are both exact numbers and are numerically
unequal (in the sense of =).
</li>
<li>
obj1 and obj2 are both inexact numbers such that either
they are numerically unequal (in the sense of =),
or they do not yield the same results (in the sense
of eqv?) when passed as arguments to any other procedure
that can be defined as a finite composition of
Scheme's standard arithmetic procedures, provided it
does not result in a NaN value. As an exception, the
behavior of eqv? is unspecified when both obj1 and
obj2 are NaN.
</li>
<li>
obj1 and obj2 are characters for which the char=? procedure
returns #f.
</li>
<li>
 one of obj1 and obj2 is the empty list but the other is
not.
</li>
<li>
obj1 and obj2 are pairs, vectors, bytevectors, records,
or strings that denote distinct locations.
</li>
<li>
obj1 and obj2 are procedures that would behave differently
(return different values or have different side effects) for some arguments.
</li>
</ul>
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <div class="code-block">
(eqv? 'a 'a) ==&gt; #t
(eqv? 'a 'b) ==&gt; #f
(eqv? 2 2) ==&gt; #t
(eqv? 2 2.0) ==&gt; #f
(eqv? '() '()) ==&gt; #t
(eqv? 100000000 100000000) ==&gt; #t
(eqv? 0.0 +nan.0) ==&gt; #f
(eqv? (cons 1 2) (cons 1 2))==&gt; #f
(eqv? (lambda () 1)
(lambda () 2)) ==&gt; #f
(let ((p (lambda (x) x)))
(eqv? p p)) ==&gt; #t
(eqv? #f 'nil) ==&gt; #f
</div>
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <br />
The following examples illustrate cases in which the above
rules do not fully specify the behavior of eqv?. All that
can be said about such cases is that the value returned by
eqv? must be a boolean.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <div class="code-block">
(eqv? "" "") ==&gt; unspecified
(eqv? '#() '#()) ==&gt; unspecified
(eqv? (lambda (x) x)
(lambda (x) x)) ==&gt; unspecified
(eqv? (lambda (x) x)
(lambda (y) y)) ==&gt; unspecified
(eqv? 1.0e0 1.0f0) ==&gt; unspecified
(eqv? +nan.0 +nan.0) ==&gt; unspecified
</div>
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <br />
Note that (eqv? 0.0 -0.0) will return #f if negative zero
is distinguished, and #t if negative zero is not distinguished.
</div></p>

<p>
<div id="eq?" class="obj-box">
  <div class="obj-header">
    <span class="code">(eq? </span>
    <span class="code-var">obj1 obj2</span>
    <span class="code">)</span>
    <span class="obj-type">procedure</span>
  </div>
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
The eq? procedure is similar to eqv? except that in some
cases it is capable of discerning distinctions finer than those
detectable by eqv?. It must always return #f when eqv?
also would, but may return #f in some cases where eqv?
would return #t.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <br />
On symbols, booleans, the empty list, pairs, and records,
and also on non-empty strings, vectors, and bytevectors,
eq? and eqv? are guaranteed to have the same behavior.
On procedures, eq? must return true if the arguments' location
tags are equal. On numbers and characters, eq?'s
behavior is implementation-dependent, but it will always
return either true or false. On empty strings, empty vectors,
and empty bytevectors, eq? may also behave differently 
from eqv?.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <div class="code-block">
(eq? 'a 'a) ==&gt; #t
(eq? '(a) '(a)) ==&gt; unspecified
(eq? (list 'a) (list 'a)) ==&gt; #f
(eq? "a" "a") ==&gt; unspecified
(eq? "" "") ==&gt; unspecified
(eq? '() '()) ==&gt; #t
(eq? 2 2) ==&gt; unspecified
(eq? #\A #\A)
</div></div></p>

<p>
<div id="equal?" class="obj-box">
  <div class="obj-header">
    <span class="code">(equal? </span>
    <span class="code-var">obj1 obj2</span>
    <span class="code">)</span>
    <span class="obj-type">procedure</span>
  </div>
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
The equal? procedure, when applied to pairs, vectors,
strings and bytevectors, recursively compares them, returning
#t when the unfoldings of its arguments into (possibly
infinite) trees are equal (in the sense of
equal?
) as ordered
trees, and
#f
otherwise. It returns the same as
eqv?
when
applied to booleans, symbols, numbers, characters, ports,
procedures, and the empty list. If two objects are
eqv?
,
they must be
equal?
as well. In all other cases,
equal?
may return either
#t
or
#f.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
  <div class="code-block">
(equal? 'a 'a)
    ==&gt; #t
(equal? '(a) '(a))
    ==&gt; #t
(equal? '(a (b) c)
'(a (b) c))
    ==&gt; #t
(equal? "abc" "abc")
    ==&gt; #t
(equal? 2 2)
    ==&gt; #t
(equal? (make-vector 5 'a)
(make-vector 5 'a))
    ==&gt; #t
</div>
  <div class="p"><!----></div> 
  <br />
Note:
A rule of thumb is that objects are generally equal? if
they print the same.
