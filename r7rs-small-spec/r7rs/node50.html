<P>
A Scheme program consists of  
one or more import declarations followed by a sequence of
expressions and definitions.
Import declarations specify the libraries on which a program or library depends;
a subset of the identifiers exported by the libraries are made available to
the program.
Expressions are described in chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node26.html#expressionchapter">4</A>.
Definitions are either variable definitions, syntax definitions, or
record-type definitions, all of which are explained in this chapter.
They are valid in some, but not all, contexts where expressions
are allowed, specifically at the outermost level of a program
and at the beginning of a body.
</P>
<P>
At the outermost level of a program, <code>(begin {expression or definition}</code> is
equivalent to the sequence of expressions and definitions
in the <code>begin</code>.   
Similarly, in a body, <code>(begin {definition})</code> is equivalent
to the sequence <code>{definition} ...</code>.
Macros can expand into such <code>begin</code> forms.
For the formal definition, see&nbsp;<A HREF="node38.html#sequencing">4.2.3</A>.
</P>
<P>
Import declarations and definitions
cause bindings to be created in the global
environment or modify the value of existing global bindings.
The initial environment of a program is empty,
so at least one import declaration is needed to introduce initial bindings.
</P>
<P>
Expressions occurring at the outermost level of a program
do not create any bindings.  They are
executed in order when the program is
invoked or loaded, and typically perform some kind of initialization.
</P>
<P>
Programs and libraries are typically stored in files, although
in some implementations they can be entered interactively into a running
Scheme system.  Other paradigms are possible.
Implementations which store libraries in files should document the
mapping from the name of a library to its location in the file system.
