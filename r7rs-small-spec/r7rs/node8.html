<P>
<SMALL CLASS="FOOTNOTESIZE">Scheme, like most dialects of Lisp, employs a fully parenthesized prefix
notation for programs and other data; the grammar of Scheme generates a
sublanguage of the language used for data.  An important
consequence of this simple, uniform representation is that
Scheme programs and data can easily be treated uniformly by other Scheme programs.
For example, the <span class="code">eval</span> procedure evaluates a Scheme program expressed
as data.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="FOOTNOTESIZE">The <span class="code">read</span> procedure performs syntactic as well as lexical decomposition of
the data it reads.  The <span class="code">read</span> procedure parses its input as data, not as program.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="FOOTNOTESIZE">The formal syntax of Scheme is described in section 7.1 of the R<sup>7</sup>RS report.
