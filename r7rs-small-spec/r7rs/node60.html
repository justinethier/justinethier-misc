<P>
The following example shows
how a program can be divided into libraries plus a relatively small
main program&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node105.html#life">16</A>].
If the main program is entered into a REPL, it is not necessary to import
the base library.

<P>
JAE TODO: do not list program here, but link to a husk example in the github source tree. 
it would be the three game of life example files in the husk tree.
