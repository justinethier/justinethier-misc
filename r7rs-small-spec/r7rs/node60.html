<P>
The game of life example program <a href="https://github.com/justinethier/husk-scheme/blob/master/examples/game-of-life/life.scm">life.scm</a>
shows how a program can be divided into libraries plus a relatively small
main program&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node105.html#life">16</A>].
</P>

<p>
<b>Note</b> when developing a library, the file containing the <code>define-library</code> code must be saved into a <code>.sld</code> file. Also, the name and location of the file must match the library name. 
</p>

<p>
For example, a library defined as 
<div class="code-block">
(define-library (example grid)

</div> 
</p>

<p>
would need to be saved in a file with the directory location and name 
<div class="code-block">
example/grid.sld

</div>
