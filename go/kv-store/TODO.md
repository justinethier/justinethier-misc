- Hook LSB implementation up to web interface when ready
- Have a static web page that makes it easy to perform RUD operations. EG: post entered data to a key, or update/delete that key
- Consider a hybrid in-memory map/cache and disked-back LSB for both speed an reliability
- LSB optimizations - index, bloom filter, etc
- Thread save LSB operations and/or use a dedicated thread with a buffered channel for other threads to send (and load??) data to the LSB
