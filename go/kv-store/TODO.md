- Add bloom filter, maybe as another package used by lsb?
- other optimizations? indexes?
- Hook LSB implementation up to web interface when ready
- Have a static web page that makes it easy to perform RUD operations. EG: post entered data to a key, or update/delete that key
- Consider a hybrid in-memory map/cache and disked-back LSB for both speed an reliability
- LSB optimizations - index, bloom filter, etc
- Thread save LSB operations and/or use a dedicated thread with a buffered channel for other threads to send (and load??) data to the LSB
- Use http.DetectContentType if content type is not supplied (EG: empty string)
- Add a write-ahead-log (WAL) to handle crashes. otherwise un-flushed data might be lost
- Reformat everything using `gofmt -w file`
- New project name - keva. Or maybe "keyva"
- Extract sst out into its own package. Also have a util package as well, and move util.go there. we can have a log package for the old log implementation
