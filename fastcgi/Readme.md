TODO / roadmap: 

- make a working demo and have it do something interesting
- provide basic project description,
- installation/build instructions 
- include an arch linux script for getting packages?
- and usage
- first need to get controllers working (think we are there?) and build a demo REST API
- then get models working at some level (maybe postgres integration?)
- then figure out views for a UI (would be sweet to have a demo using Angular or such)

# Installation

## Arch Linux

    pacman -Sy
    pacman -S pacman
