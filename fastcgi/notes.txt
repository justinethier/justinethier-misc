- threaded example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5829869/multi-threaded-fastcgi-app
 the full example is here:

Install:

pacman -S nginx fcgi fcgiwrap spawn-fcgi

# run nginx using the provided configuration
sudo nginx -c <absolute path to nginx.conf>

# spawn the fcgi app on port 8000 with no fork
spawn-fcgi -p 8000 -n example


For next steps forward, TODO:
- ideally need a thread-safe container for the request objects, and a way for threads to call into it. maybe a list of opaque objects, but then how does a thread index into that? want this to prevent having every controller function take a request argument

- REST integration, add support for get/post/put/delete methods
- as part of that, need to be able to receive POST args (and PUT/DELETE, are those the same?)
- as part of that, also need a way to format returned sexps as json/xml/other.
  basically will want to call a function that accepts an expression and does all of the
  writing to stdout for the object
- clean up main, relocating code to libraries as needed (or maybe this is good enough?)
- make scheme code multithreaded (see threaded.c example)
- once that all works, start thinking about views
- project name: cyclone web?
