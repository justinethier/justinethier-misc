Install:

pacman -S nginx fcgi fcgiwrap spawn-fcgi

# run nginx using the provided configuration
sudo nginx -c <absolute path to nginx.conf>

# spawn the fcgi app on port 8000 with no fork
spawn-fcgi -p 8000 -n example


For next steps forward:

- fast CGI docs.
  this may be a good start: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FastCGI-Archives/fcgi2/master/doc/fastcgi-prog-guide/ch2c.htm

also, for source code:
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/FastCGI-Archives/fcgi2/blob/master/doc/overview.html

- threaded example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5829869/multi-threaded-fastcgi-app
 the full example is here:
 https://github.com/LuaDist/fcgi/blob/master/examples/threaded.c

- following up on that, possible to configure FCGI_MAX_CONNS, other constants?

TODO:
- clean up the existing C example, extend as needed (pthreads??)
  NO, instead get the threaded.c example up and running
- port to cyclone
- create cyclone libraries: FCGI, HTTP
