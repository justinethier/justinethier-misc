- fast CGI docs.
  this may be a good start: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FastCGI-Archives/fcgi2/master/doc/fastcgi-prog-guide/ch2c.htm

also, for source code:

- threaded example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5829869/multi-threaded-fastcgi-app
 the full example is here:
 https://github.com/LuaDist/fcgi/blob/master/examples/threaded.c

Install:

pacman -S nginx fcgi fcgiwrap spawn-fcgi

# run nginx using the provided configuration
sudo nginx -c <absolute path to nginx.conf>

# spawn the fcgi app on port 8000 with no fork
spawn-fcgi -p 8000 -n example


For next steps forward, TODO:
- create app/models, controllers, views?
- try to think/experiment with how these would work to contain a web app.
  also if it makes sense to organize things this way
- want to move all libraries underneath a 'lib' dir
- rework makefile (make executable name, included libs, cyclone installed location all variables, what else??)
