Install:

pacman -S nginx fcgi fcgiwrap spawn-fcgi

# run nginx using the provided configuration
sudo nginx -c <absolute path to nginx.conf>

# spawn the fcgi app on port 8000 with no fork
spawn-fcgi -p 8000 -n example


For next steps forward:

- port to cyclone
- threaded example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5829869/multi-threaded-fastcgi-app
- following up on that, possible to configure FCGI_MAX_CONNS, other constants?
- create cyclone libraries: FCGI, HTTP
